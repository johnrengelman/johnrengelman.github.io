## Course Description

This graduate course considers two closely related but distinct concepts in systems engineering, verification and validation.
_Verification_ is “The process of evaluating a system or component to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase.” (IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology, Standard 610.12-1990.)
_Validation_ is the act of assessing the requirements, design, and development of a product to ensure that it will meet the user’s requirements, operational needs, and expectations at the time of delivery.
These activities occur throughout the systems engineering cycle, not simply at the end. Systems engineering verification and validation practices will be studied and applied in appropriate situations.
This course considers validation and verification across the system boundary of system elements to include: hardware, software, humans, and life cycle elements.

## Prerequisites

* ETLS 507 - Introduction to Systems Design
* ETLS 508 - Systems Design

## Required Texts

* _INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook_ – reference text (available free online)

## Additional Texts

* _Guide to the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK)_, Version 1.3 released May 2014.
  The Systems Engineering Book of Knowledge can be downloaded free of charge at:
  [http://www.sebokwiki.org/w/downloads/SEBoKv1.3_full.pdf](http://www.sebokwiki.org/w/downloads/SEBoKv1.3_full.pdd)
  The Engineering Book of Knowledge can also be viewed via its wiki interface at:
  [http://www.sebokwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page](http://www.sebokwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page)
* “Technical Measurement; A collaborative Project of PSM, INCOSE and Industry,” December 2005, INCOSE-TP-2003-020-01, which can be downloaded free of charge at:
  [https://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/pdf/TechMeasurementGuide_2005-1227.pdf](https://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/pdf/TechMeasurementGuide_2005-1227.pdf)
* _A Systems Engineering Capability Maturity Model_, Version 1.1
  [http://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=12291](https://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/pdf/TechMeasurementGuide_2005-1227.pdf)
  Some engineering organizations utilize a systems engineering capability maturity model as part of the documentation of their system’s engineering processes.  Capability models will not be covered within this course as the use of such models is principally sought for organizations dealing with the US Department of Defense.  It is mentioned here as a reference for students that may work in such organizations.

## Course Objectives

* The student will be familiar with the role of systems engineering in the life cycle phases of a product or system.
* The student will be able to develop a broad spectrum of quantifiable measures of system effectiveness i.e. requirements.
* The student will be able to define means of validating that the system achieves the quantifiable measures of system effectiveness i.e. requirements 4.8 INCOSE.
* The student will be able to define means of verifying that the system achieves the quantifiable measures of system effectiveness i.e. requirements 4.6 INCOSE.

## Course Methodology

A mix of lecture, case studies, class discussion, in-class role playing, and student
presentations will be used to cover the course materials.

## Class Schedule

[Class Schedule](schedule.html)

<br/>

### Major Assignments

The students will be responsible for the following elements of class

1. Mid Term Presentation    25%
1. Final Presentation       25%
1. Project                  40%
1. Class Participation      10%

An important aspect of this class is an ability to synthesize the concepts presented, with personal experiences, knowledge and abilities.  
Everyone in class will benefit from your participation.


### Grading Policy

Student achievement will be measured based on the two presentations, written project and class participation.  
An overview of the project is provided at the end of the syllabus. Class members will be graded on overall performance of the class.  
Grades will be affected by timelines of completion.

## Academic Integrity

All students are expected to understand and follow the University of St.Thomas
policies on Academic Integrity. These are described at: [http://www.stthomas.edu/engineering/graduate/policies/2011-12acadintegrity](http://www.stthomas.edu/engineering/graduate/policies/2011-12acadintegrity)

Don’t cheat and don’t plagiarize.

Here are five ways of plagiarizing:

1. Word-for-word continuous copying without quotation marks or mention of the author’s name.
1. Copying many words and phrases without quotation marks or mention of the author’s name.
1. Copying an occasional key word or phrase without quotation marks or mention of the author’s name.
1. Paraphrasing without mention of the author’s name.
1. Taking the author’s idea without acknowledging the source.

_Note:_
All work not designated as a team activity is expected to be accomplished individually.
Any situation demonstrating collaboration or collusion in individual work in this class will result in a 0 grade for all parties and a reduction in letter grade for the course.

## Attendance

Students are expected to attend all class sessions.
Circumstances that prevent attendance will be honored up to two instances.
Absences in excess of two times will result in a lowered grade for the course.
Contact the instructor when a special situation arises.
All absences require that the instructor be informed in advance.

## Disability Policy

Academic accommodations will be provided for qualified students with documented disabilities including but not limited to mental health diagnoses, learning disabilities, Attention Deficit Disorder, chronic medical conditions, visual, mobility, and hearing disabilities.
Students are invited to contact the Disability Resources office about accommodations early in the semester.
Appointments can be made by calling 651-962-6315 or in person in Murray Herrick, room 110.
For further information, you can locate the Disability Resources office on the web at [http://www.stthomas.edu/enhancementprog/](http://www.stthomas.edu/enhancementprog/).
