I've recently switched over to using IntelliJ IDEA for doing Groovy/Grails development. It's been a couple weeks and after 6 years of using Eclipse, I'm still feeling the pain a bit.

On top of a new IDE, I'm now developing primarily on my new MacBook Pro. So that's adding to the transition. My biggest problem has been the slowness of IntelliJ. It randomly just locks up for a few minutes before continuing on.

So, I did what any normal software developer would do: I turned to Google for the answer. I very quickly found this little page: [IntelliJ IDEA 10 performance on Mac](http://blog.amber.org/2010/12/intellij-idea-10-performance-on-mac-os-x). Thanks to [Chris](http://blog.amber.org/about/) and a couple other random postings (one key info was to turn off the vast selection of IDEA plugins that are enabled by default and aren't used), I got my system running much, much, much faster.
