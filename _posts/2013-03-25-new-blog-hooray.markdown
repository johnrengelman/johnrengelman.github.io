So I've decided to switch my blog over from a Wordpress sited hosted on a server in my basement to Tumblr. I don't blog that much, but I want to do more and I don't really want the responsibility of maintaining the server. Also, I want to keep my technical posts and my more mundane posts separate.

I'm going to republish some old posts of mine to this blog. I'm also going to republish some blog posts from my [Object Partners](http://www.objectpartners.com) blog here as well.
