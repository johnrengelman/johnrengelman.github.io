        <p>Only a few months ago, I decided to switch my personal blog (which isn’t maintained very well)<br />
from a privately hosted Wordpress installation on a server in my basement to Tumblr. There<br />
were a lot of reasons for this but the biggest was, I’m not very interested in maintaining that<br />
server anymore.</p>

        <p>Lately I’ve been working on a way to create a reproducible build of my application source using Gradle. And by reproducible, I mean, when I run the md5 or sha256 checksum on the resulting files, I get the same results.</p>

        <p>As I was adding a new post today, I noticed an old post of mine that I had migrated from my old blog to this one about using IntelliJ and comparing it with STS. It’s a little over 2 years old and in it I make the statement “STS which is based on Eclipse, which I consider to be the premier Java IDE”;.</p>

        <p>So I’ve decided to switch my blog over from a Wordpress sited hosted on a server in my basement to Tumblr. I don’t blog that much, but I want to do more and I don’t really want the responsibility of maintaining the server. Also, I want to keep my technical posts and my more mundane posts separate.</p>

        </h2>
        
        <p>I’ve recently started to work on contributing patches to the Grails Framework project. I’ve been lucky enough to be working for a client that is ok with using the latest versions of Grails for its back-end applications, so I’ve been able to play around a lot with Grails 2.0.0 since it’s release at the end of last year. However, this has resulted in me encountering a number of unexpected/irritating bugs that have sometimes prevented code from being migrated “as-is”. So, I’ve decided to try and learn and contribute back by working on some bugs myself.</p>

        </h2>
        
        <p>So, I have become increasingly frustrated with IntelliJ for doing Grails development. I know. Everyone swears by it being “THE” IDE for Grails work, but I just can’t get on that boat. Not only do I find the UI a total cluster-fuck and it nearly impossible to find the information that I want on the screen when I want it, but it is also a serious resource hog.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

        <p>I’ve recently switched over to using IntelliJ IDEA for doing Groovy/Grails development. It’s been a couple weeks and after 6 years of using Eclipse, I’m still feeling the pain a bit.</p>

        <p>Tonight, I decided to setup a multisite configuration for my Wordpress installation (which you are reading right now). My sister is involved in marketing and advertising and wanted to start her own blog. I figured this was a good opportunity to play with the server some more.</p>
