    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Only a few months ago, I decided to switch my personal blog (which isn&rsquo;t maintained very well)
from a privately hosted Wordpress installation on a server in my basement to Tumblr. There
were a lot of reasons for this but the biggest was, I&rsquo;m not very interested in maintaining that
server anymore.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Tumblr has ben ok. But I&rsquo;ve found that, I don&rsquo;t like any blogging platform where I have to link
to an external page to get source code included in the blog post (lame/too much effort). The
obvious choice to correct this was to use something based on Markdown so I can write code
inline. And that inevitably led me to using Github Pages.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all well and good, but Github Pages doesn&rsquo;t provided any type of default scheming, you
are responsible for everything. That&rsquo;s cool if you&rsquo;re into that kind of stuff, but CSS and
skinning has never been a strong suite of mine. So, I needed something with some generic, yet
good looking templates. In comes Octopress.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just starting to learn the ropes here, so I&rsquo;ll be doing a lot to play with this platform
before finally switching the DNS record over, but so far I&rsquo;m happy.</p>

<p>More to come!</p>
